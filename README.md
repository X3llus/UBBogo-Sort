# UBBogo Sort
We decided to try to optimize bogo sort after choosing it for a sorting algorithm presentation in comp sci class.
To do this we made each number in the list unique by removing all copies of a number and storing the number of copies in a second list.
After that we break it into blocks of 6 numbers and bogo each block than merge the blocks back together.
Finally we add back in all extra numbers, the range of numbers we generated was 1 to 10% of the list size.
